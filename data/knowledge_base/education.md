## Research Publications

During my academic journey, I authored and published two research papers:

### 1. To Laugh or Not to Laugh: LSTM-Based Humor Detection Approach

**Publisher**: IEEE
**Published in**: 2021 12th International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)
**Date Added to IEEE Xplore**: 03 November 2021
**Year**: 2021
**Date of Conference**: 06-08 July 2021
**DOI**: 10.1109/ICCCNT51525.2021.9580124
**Conference Location**: Kharagpur, India

**Abstract**: Humor holds the power to turn any mundane conversation into something more enthralling. It is an important feature of personal communication. Sentiment Analysis helps people as well as corporations to comprehend the attitudes of people towards certain words based on how they are strung together. Particularly, Humor Detection facilitates the understanding of underlying relations of words and how various combinations of strings can invoke laughter. In this paper, an approach to identify the presence of humor in sentences, using a model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), is adopted. LSTM is a specialized version of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). While conventional RNNs involve cyclic connections for modeling sequenced data, LSTM uses additional units for retaining information for comparatively long periods. A wide-ranging, evenly distributed dataset is used in the implementation of the model. After preprocessing, the data progresses along the embedding layer, LSTM layer and the dense layer and the outcome is finally compiled. Ultimately, the model states whether a given statement is humorous or not. The proposed LSTM model gives an accuracy of 94.62%. As new sources of obtaining humorous content keep emerging through multimedia, new patterns can be discovered. Understanding such patterns through such existing Humor Detection models can promote the development of Automated Humor Generation Systems.

**Key Contributions**:

- Novel feature engineering for humor detection
- LSTM architecture optimized for text classification
- Comprehensive dataset analysis

**Technical Details**:

- Natural Language Processing
- LSTM neural networks
- Text preprocessing and feature extraction
- Model evaluation and validation

### 2. Generation and Grading of Arduous MCQs Using NLP and OMR Detection Using OpenCV

**Publisher**: IEEE
**Published in**: 2021 12th International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)
**Date Added to IEEE Xplore**: 03 November 2021
**Year**: 2021
**Date of Conference**: 06-08 July 2021
**DOI**: 10.1109/ICCCNT51525.2021.9580089
**Conference Location**: Kharagpur, India

**Abstract**: During the 21st century pandemic, it has become difficult for students and teachers to engage physically in the aftermath of the epidemic, the process of assessing and grading students has become cumbersome. Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) have increasingly become a more popular method of assessing a person's knowledge, but the questions which are generated directly from the chapter provided are readily available on the internet. Thus évaluer, the proposed approach solves this problem by paraphrasing the text, and thus the questions, so as to make it difficult to look it up on the internet. Usage of OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) sheets or manual correction had been prominent in the pre-pandemics situation. The évaluer automates the process of generation of MCQs which are difficult to search on the internet, and speeds up the task of grading a candidate's OMR answer sheet.

**Key Contributions**:

- NLP-based question generation from text corpus
- Difficulty level assessment algorithms
- OMR detection system using OpenCV
- End-to-end automated grading pipeline

**Technical Details**:

- Natural Language Processing
- Question generation algorithms
- Computer Vision (OpenCV)
- OMR (Optical Mark Recognition)
- Automated assessment systems

**Impact**:

- Reduces manual effort in question paper preparation
- Enables objective difficulty calibration
- Automates grading process
- Applicable in educational technology

# About Sarjak Maniar

Hi! I'm Sarjak Maniar, an AI Data Scientist based in Boston, USA. I specialize in building intelligent systems that transform data into actionable insights and automated solutions.

## Current Focus

I'm actively seeking full-time opportunities in AI and Data Science where I can apply my expertise in Data Science and AI to solve complex business problems. I'm excited about roles that bridge traditional data science with modern AI applications. Of cource, my roots are assosciated with core traditional machine learning and that helps me to not lose focus for any given business problem.

## Professional Identity

I'm an AI Data Scientist who believes data is more than numbers—it's a story waiting to be understood. My foundation lies in data science: statistics, machine learning, and analytical storytelling. But I'm equally drawn to exploring how AI can make systems smarter, faster, and more human-centered.

I enjoy bridging the gap between traditional analytics and modern AI applications, whether it's automating insights, creating intelligent tools, or experimenting with new learning frameworks like LangChain, LangGraph, and RAG systems.

## What Drives Me

The quote by Anthony J. D'Angelo resonates deeply with me: *"Develop a passion for learning. If you do, you will never cease to grow."* This mindset shapes how I approach every project—with focus, humility, and a desire to keep evolving.

At my core, I'm data-driven but people-focused—committed to building reliable, transparent, and impactful data solutions that help others make better decisions.
